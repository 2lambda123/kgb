	TKSGB KERNEL

A Linux 2.6.35.7 kernel for SCH-I500 devices running Gingerbread and TouchWiz

Originally based on Samsung's EH09 source drop for Mesmerize. Relevant updates have been made from EI20 and EH03.



	BUILDING THE KERNEL

Set up a build environment. Obtain and install/unpack an appropriate cross-compiler toolchain targeting the ARM architecture, such as Sourcery CodeBench Lite. Kernel building does not require anything more than ARM EABI support. Bear in mind that building things that aren't kernels (e.g. busybox) is impossible with a toolchain only targeting the ARM EABI.

Edit /build.sh, where / is the kernel root directory, to set TOOLCHAIN and TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX correctly for your setup. For example, if you installed Sourcery Lite arm-2011.03 GNU/Linux to /opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03, then those lines would read "TOOLCHAIN=/opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03/bin" and "TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-".

While not strictly necessary when using the build scripts, setting CROSS_COMPILE in /Makefile is probably a good idea anyway. In the above example, "CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-".

Run build.sh. Output, including Odin and CWM packages, will be sent to in /build/out. Note that this directory is automatically destroyed at the beginning of each build.

Alternatively, run build_log.sh, a wrapper script that calls build.sh and logs all the screen output to a text file in /.
