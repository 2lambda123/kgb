	KGB KERNEL - A Kernel for Gingerbread

Linux 2.6.35.7 kernel for SCH-I500 devices running TouchWiz Gingerbread ROMs

Originally based on Samsung's EH09 source drop for Mesmerize. Relevant updates have been made from EI20 and EH03.


	BUILDING THE KERNEL

1. Set up a build environment.

2. Obtain and install/unpack an appropriate cross-compiler toolchain targeting the ARM architecture, such as Sourcery Lite arm-2011.03 GNU/Linux.

Edit build.sh and set TOOLCHAIN and TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX. Also edit Makefile and set CROSS_COMPILE. These should correspond to the location of the toolchain and the filenames within the /bin directory where the toolchain is installed.

For example, if you installed Sourcery Lite arm-2011.03 GNU/Linux to /opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03:
TOOLCHAIN=/opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03/bin
TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/toolchains/arm-2011.03/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

3. Run one of the following from the command line:
./build.sh  (Build the kernel)
./build_log.sh (Build the kernel, and log the process to a text file in the kernel source directory)

4. Copy the Odin and/or CWM packages that are created in /build/out to somewhere else.
The build script automatically deletes /build/out at the beginning of every build.
